# Warmth Obsidian theme

a light theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app with warm earth tones. 

**no longer maintained - check out my new theme, now with colors from warmth**

## updated title bar - 2021.06.01

after numerous requests, i've updated the broken titlebar. it now looks much better. 

there are a number of other visual issues that really, really bug me, so i think i'll spend some time updating this theme very soon.

## installation

this theme is part of the community themes. you can easily install from within the app itself. 

to manually install, download **warmth.css** and place into the **.obsidian/themes/** folder in your vault. you can switch to this theme under **settings > appearance > theme** option. 

a lot of people are using it even though it needs a lot of updating and refining. i pulled some of the colors from the warmth theme into my more current theme [al-dente](https://github.com/chad-bennett/al-dente-obsidian-theme). it has become my main driver. i hope you like it too.

as always, please let me know if there are issues or tweaks you think would improve the theme.

using [Metropolis](https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Metropolis) font, but can easily swap out for you favorite font. 

***a work in progress, so if you have ideas for tweaks or changes, please let me know.***
