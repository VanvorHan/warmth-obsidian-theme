# Warmth Obsidian theme

a light theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app with warm earth tones. 

**no longer maintained - check out my new theme, now with colors from warmth**

this theme is part of the community themes. a lot of people are using it even though it needs a lot of updating and refining. i pulled some of the colors from the warmth theme into my more current theme [al-dente](https://github.com/chad-bennett/al-dente-obsidian-theme). it has become my main driver. i hope you like it too.

as always, please let me know if there are issues or tweaks you think would improve the theme.

using [Metropolis](https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Metropolis) font, but can easily swap out for you favorite font. 

***a work in progress, so if you have ideas for tweaks or changes, please let me know.***
